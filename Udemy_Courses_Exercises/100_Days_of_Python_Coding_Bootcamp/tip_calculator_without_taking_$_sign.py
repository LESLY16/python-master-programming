#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Here round function doesn't round the final tip to 2 decimal places
#hence format the result to 2 decimal places thus we get 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
'''
: introduces the format spec
0 enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types
.2 sets the precision to 2
f displays the number as a fixed-point number
